      I didn't run into too many issues during this assignment since I'm pretty
      familiar with the basics of HTML already. I've been using Github for quite
      a while now so committing/pushing wasn't too much of an issue.

      I found my text editor Atom to be the most useful resource in completing this
      assignment since it autoclosed my HTML tags.

		This assignment wasn't too challenging, however it required me to research and loko into various parts of CSS which I wasn't aware of. I struggled trying to get the todo notes to be responsive when the page size was changed until I learned about display: flex. I found that just doing a simple Google search for CSS *insert what I'm trying to accomplish* usually brough up a w3schools page with lots of answers regarding CSS and I was able to implement what I wanted based on the documentation.

		I found that I already knew the basics of CSS like creating a circle and how to change colors and various hover elements. I did learn about stacking effects, such as hovering the todo note would cause the x to show in the corner. The w3schools website was an extremely useful resource for this assignment and helped me accomplish alot of what I did.

		I had to Google how to hide an element until hovering over it, as well as changing the cursor to a particular cursor.
