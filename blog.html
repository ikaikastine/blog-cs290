    <p>
      I didn't run into too many issues during this assignment since I'm pretty
      familiar with the basics of HTML already. I've been using Github for quite
      a while now so committing/pushing wasn't too much of an issue.

      I found my text editor Atom to be the most useful resource in completing this
      assignment since it autoclosed my HTML tags.
