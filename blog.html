      I didn't run into too many issues during this assignment since I'm pretty
      familiar with the basics of HTML already. I've been using Github for quite
      a while now so committing/pushing wasn't too much of an issue.

      I found my text editor Atom to be the most useful resource in completing this
      assignment since it autoclosed my HTML tags.

		This assignment wasn't too challenging, however it required me to research and look into various parts of CSS which I wasn't aware of. I struggled trying to get the todo notes to be responsive when the page size was changed until I learned about display: flex. I found that just doing a simple Google search for CSS *insert what I'm trying to accomplish* usually brough up a w3schools page with lots of answers regarding CSS and I was able to implement what I wanted based on the documentation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found that I already knew the basics of CSS like creating a circle and how to change colors and various hover elements. I did learn about stacking effects, such as hovering the todo note would cause the x to show in the corner. The w3schools website was an extremely useful resource for this assignment and helped me accomplish alot of what I did.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had to Google how to hide an element until hovering over it, as well as changing the cursor to a particular cursor.

		This assignment was a bit challenging getting started. I've done some JavaScript before, however it was generally to do specific things for building a page dynamically based on a JSON file. I struggled getting the event listeners working, until I realized that I needed to loop through the elements when using the getElementsByClassName. Once I got that concept down the rest of the assignment was relatively simple.

		I did run into an issue when creating the todo note with the correct input fields. The way I was creating it was by just editing the innerHTML to match the actual HTML code and putting that after a appendChild to create the div. What I failed to realize was that when doing the appendChild, it creates elements in the DOM rather than just editing the source code. Therefore all of my when/where/who fields were being placed after the end of the todo-body div. I had to then change everything so I could just use appendChild to add the elements. Once it was done it seemed like a much easier implementation anyway and would work for scalability if I ever needed to add new input fields.

		This assignment was actually a lot easier for me than some of the other ones.
		After having to initially wrap my head around the asynchronous functions, I was able to get a pretty good understanding of NodeJS.
		I ran into a problem when trying to make sure that if the user specified the root directory, the server would serve the index.html page.
		Finally I found that I could use statSync(filename).isDirectory() to solve my issues.
	</p>
	<p>
		I learned that there are probably many different ways to get a simple server up and running, and my implementation probably was not the quickest or easiest way.
		I pretty much use the same three read file functions, the only difference is checking if it's a directory, file that exists or doesn't.
		I'm sure there is an easier and more efficient way of implementing a solution but mine works pretty well.
		The documentation page for NodeJS was the most helpful as I was able to get almost all the information I needed from there.
		I had to Google how to check if it's a directory, and how to setup Cache-Control.
